| [Applying Text Mining for Identifying Future Signals of Land Administration](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/12/181) | [Land](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/land), 2019 | How can future signals be detected through text mining? Authors recommend 1) keyword filtering (based on term frequency, document frequency) in combination with 2) topic modeling. Keywords (and the topics that include them) are ranked by degree of visibility (**DoV**) and degree of diffusion (**DoD**). Visualization through keyword emergence/issue maps. Especially weak signals still need quantitative + qualitative approach. | Text mining, topic modeling, future signal, signal detection |
| [Identification of future signal based on the quantitative and qualitative text mining: a case study on ethical issues in artificial intelligence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-017-0582-8) | [Quality & Quantity](https://www.springer.com/journal/11135), 2017 | Identifying future signals and categorizing them into *strong*, *weak*, *latent* and *well-known but not strong* is important for research and policy makers. Combining quantitative metrics (**DoV** and **DoD**) with a qualitative approach (interpretation of keywords, and reviewing source material to verify keyword clusters that form topics based on co-occurrences). Authors acknowledge that methodological foundations of finding future patterns are still "challenging". Semantic analysis probably helpful. | Future signal, signal detection, qualitative
