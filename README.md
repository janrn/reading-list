| Title | Venue/Year | Summary | Keywords |

| [Tired of Topic Models? Clusters of Pretrained Word Embeddings Make for Fast and Good Topics too!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14914.pdf) | [Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/2020.emnlp-main/), 2020 | The authors propose an alternative to LDA, by clustering (pre-trained) word embeddings to obtain topics. According to their evaluations it performs as well as classical approaches, but with a lower runtime. | Topic modeling |
| [Evaluation criteria to assess the value of identification sources for horizon scanning](http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/17448534/SmithCookPackerS026646231000036Xa.pdf) | [International journal of technology assessment in health care](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-technology-assessment-in-health-care), 2010 | Deciding whether a source is useful for horizon scanning is a complex and not standardized process. The authors present a system based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP, by Saaty) to rank sources through experts in horizon scanning. This manual and time-consuming process could, according to the authors, be seen as groundwork for automated decision systems, or technological support for scholars. | Horizon scanning, source identification, source ranking |
| [Applying Text Mining for Identifying Future Signals of Land Administration](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/12/181) | [Land](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/land), 2019 | How can future signals be detected through text mining? Authors recommend 1) keyword filtering (based on term frequency, document frequency) in combination with 2) topic modeling. Keywords (and the topics that include them) are ranked by degree of visibility (**DoV**) and degree of diffusion (**DoD**). Visualization through keyword emergence/issue maps. Especially weak signals still need quantitative + qualitative approach. | Text mining, topic modeling, future signal, signal detection |
| [Identification of future signal based on the quantitative and qualitative text mining: a case study on ethical issues in artificial intelligence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-017-0582-8) | [Quality & Quantity](https://www.springer.com/journal/11135), 2017 | Identifying future signals and categorizing them into *strong*, *weak*, *latent* and *well-known but not strong* is important for research and policy makers. Combining quantitative metrics (**DoV** and **DoD**) with a qualitative approach (interpretation of keywords, and reviewing source material to verify keyword clusters that form topics based on co-occurrences). Authors acknowledge that methodological foundations of finding future patterns are still "challenging". Semantic analysis probably helpful. | Future signal, signal detection, qualitative
