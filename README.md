| [Applying Text Mining for Identifying Future Signals of Land Administration](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/12/181) | [Land](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/land), 2019 | How can future signals be detected through text mining? Authors recommend 1) keyword filtering (based on term frequency, document frequency) in combination with 2) topic modeling. Keywords (and the topics that include them) are ranked by degree of visibility (**DoV**) and degree of diffusion (**DoD**). Visualization through keyword emergence/issue maps. Especially weak signals still need quantitative + qualitative approach. | Text mining, topic modeling, future signal, signal detection |
